    "We have predicted some genes, but what does this actually do for us? Biologically, we want to assign a function\n",
    "to genes so that we can try to understand what they are doing. Now, we are going to use the second approach outlined\n",
    "at the beginning of section 4 to both identify genes and attempt to assign a biological function to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we identified genes on one chromosome of _P. falciparum_. _P. falciparum_ has been extensively\n",
    "studied, and a large proportion of the genes in its genome have been assigned some function. However, lets pretend\n",
    "that the genes we just identified are from a new exciting organism that we just sequenced, and we want to find out a\n",
    "potential function for these genes. In many cases, an organism that is relatively closely related to the one that we\n",
    "are interested in has already been sequenced, and gene discovery as outlined above has already been performed. Here is\n",
    "a phylogenetic tree of different _Plasmodium_ species from the paper:\n",

    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify genes in our assembly based on genes from _P. reichenowi_, we first have to align _P. reichenowi_ genes to our\n",
    "assembly. To do this, we use the protein sequence of _P. reichenowi_ genes and *not* the nucleotide sequence. This is\n",
    "because the amino acid code is \"degenerate\" and different sets of 3 nucleotides, or a codon, can encode for the same\n",
    "protein as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/comparative_2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chart, the first base of a codon is in the innermost circle, the second base in the next circle, and the final\n",
    "base in the last circle. In other words, working inside out, TGC codes for the amino acid Cysteine. This chart also\n",
    "demonstrates how the amino acid code is \"degenerate\". For example, the amino acid threonine can be coded by four\n",
    "different codons: ACA, ACT, ACG, or ACC.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that closely related organisms can have different nucleotide sequence, but still have the same amino acid\n",
    "sequence. In the image below, eventhough _P. falciparum_ has an \"A\" at position 9 but _P. reichenowi_ has a \"G\", both\n",
    "species proteins have a threonine amino acid as the third residue:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/comparative_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, if we use the amino acid sequence of _P. reichenowi_ genes to align to our _P. falciparum_ assembly instead of the\n",
    "DNA sequence, we have more room for error since an amino acid can match multiple nucleotides.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the codon chart above, can you align the following amino acid sequence to the nucleotide sequence below (just\n",
    "label the amino acids above the matching base)?\n",
    "2. What was difficult about this alignment?\n",
    "3. Did you notice something at the end of your alignment?\n",

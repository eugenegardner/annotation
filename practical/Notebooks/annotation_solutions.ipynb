    "\n",
    "There are many possible answers here (refer to slides 3 & 4 from the assembly presentation), including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Repetitive sequences.\n",
    "2. Low sequencing depth.\n",
    "3. Errors in reads\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: Is there an obvious issue with our assembly?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the 3' end of our assembly is missing!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: Why do you think both ends of the reference genome align to the same part of our assembled genome?**\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "more bonafide.gb\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "The main limitation is the number of genes that we can use for training. As we are only using 1 chromosome to train\n",
    "AUGUSTUS, there are only ~300 genes that can be used for training. If we use all chromosomes, that means we can use all\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question: What are both predictions missing, and why do you think that is?**\n",
    "\n",
    "They are both missing UTRs. That is because we did not tell AUGUSTUS to search for them.\n",
